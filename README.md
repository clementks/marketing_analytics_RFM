With the retail market getting more and more competitive by the day, there has never been anything more important than the ability for optimizing service business processes when trying to satisfy the expectations of customers. Channelizing and managing data with the aim of working in favor of the customer as well as generating profits is very significant for survival. The dataset is a pseudo records of any sales transaction for various category of products from any online retailers.


Ideally, a retailer’s customer data reflects the company’s success in reaching and nurturing its customers. Retailers built reports summarizing customer behavior using metrics such as conversion rate, average order value, recency of purchase and total amount spent in recent transactions. These measurements provided general insight into the behavioral tendencies of customers. It is important for a business to understand if their products are selling well. It is arguably more important to understand if their customers enjoyed the product they bought is enough to make a repeated purchase. One way to look at this is through customer retention rates, the average quantity purchased, and the average price by segmenting them into cohorts and analyze them using RFM Analysis with RFM Score formula based on quintiles.


Customer intelligence is the practice of determining and delivering data-driven insights into past and predicted future customer behavior. To be effective, customer intelligence must combine raw transactional and behavioral data to generate derived measures. In a nutshell, for big retail players all over the world, data analytics is applied more these days at all stages of the retail process – taking track of popular products that are emerging, forecasting of sales and future demand via predictive simulation, optimizing placements of products and offers through heat-mapping of customers and many others.
Retailers can also offer items that other customers who looked at similar items tend to purchase, fancy gift wrapping or some massively discounted products. Such incentives can make the overall value of the customer’s basket go up significantly, along with their satisfaction. 



Most marketers are already able to identify customer segmentation based on RFM analysis using any Business or Market Intelligence software, however, the challenge they face is finding predictive analytics solutions with prediction models that provide good precision and accuracy which is what we are tackling in this project.
The objective of this project is to build prediction models using DecisionTree Classification for customer segment type after performing the RFM analysis and Clustering. Each customer segment type could be map into customer retention or churn used as a target variable using to train the DecisionTree classification model.
